logging ph + nitrate levels from river Medway

I measured river Medway in Kent, focusing on farmland tributaries.

Checking for PH and Nitrate levels, this indicates industrial runoff, agriculture use, contamination/pollution etc.

Searching for impacts of agricultural chemicals & fertiliser were my priority, e.g. through PH and Nitrate. These can damage Kentish aquatic life through etrophication etc.

Recreated from prev. project file, included arduino uno r3.
