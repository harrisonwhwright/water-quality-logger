log ph + nitrate levels from river

measured river Medway in Kent, checking farmland tributaries.
checking for ph and nitrate, indicates industrial runoff + agriculture use + contamination/pollution etc.
agricultural chemicals and fertiliser were my main priorities, seeing if farms were contamination water ways and damaging Kentish quatic life through eutrophication etc.

recreated file from prev. project which includes arduino uno r3.
